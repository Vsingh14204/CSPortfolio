  <div class="typewriter">HELLO! WELCOME TO MY COMPUTER SCIENCE PORTFOLIO</div>
  
  <div class="text-background">
    <p>Welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Vineet Singh, a freshman student at Knox College, majoring in Computer Science. I'm thrilled to have you here and share my journey and accomplishments with you.

From a young age, I've been fascinated by the limitless potential of technology and its ability to shape the world around us. My passion for Computer Science led me to pursue it as my major, and I've been on an exciting learning journey ever since.

In this portfolio, you'll find a glimpse into my projects and endeavors that showcase my skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. Whether it's developing web applications, exploring algorithms, or diving into data analysis, I'm constantly pushing myself to grow and embrace new challenges.

But it's not just about technical skills. Collaboration and teamwork are essential aspects of my journey. I believe in the power of collective intelligence and have actively participated in hackathons and coding competitions, working alongside talented individuals to tackle complex problems.

As a freshman, I'm eager to explore the ever-evolving landscape of Computer Science and its potential to make a positive impact. I'm particularly excited about the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning, as they hold tremendous promise for solving real-world problems.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope you find inspiration, insights, and potential collaboration opportunities within my projects. Feel free to explore, and don't hesitate to reach out. I look forward to connecting with you!

Best regards,
Vineet Singh
